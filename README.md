#JavaTelegramBot

https://t.me/CatImagesBot - this is my example of longpolling bot. He is still working.

Paste your bot.name and bot.token from bot_father into application.properties file to link this code with your bot.

This bot use mySQL data base, so it wasn`t work, if you don`t install mySQL on you desktop or server. This bot linked to my linux ubuntu VPS. The path to my cat images linked under linux system paths. So if want use it for windows, you should change all linux-paths to windows-paths in CatImagesBot.java. (change all images methods)
